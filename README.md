# Lollum Framework Yoast Extension
Add content of Lollum Page Builder to Yoast SEO content analysis.

**Please note**: this is an extension for the *Lollum Framework* plugin, not for the new [Lollum Page Builder](https://github.com/lollum/lollum-page-builder) plugin.

## How it works?
The Yoast SEO plugin takes only the default content for the SEO score and feedback. It doesn't support meta boxes out of the box. With this free extension you can include the Lollum Page Builder content in its analysis.

## Supported themes
* Lotus Flower
* Big Point
* Crazy Diamond
* Nantes
